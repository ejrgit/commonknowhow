Using AI to make information flow more smooth and suggest potential area for process improvement focus

# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
All organisations use text based messaging systems for communication, sharing of information and ideas for the 
operation. Findng routine exchanges between people, departments or companies may show where automation can be used.

## Background

This project seeks to make information available across an organisation without the usual silo'd approach, instead of relying on persobal decisions to share information AI techniques will provide insight and suggestions for process improvement and automation.


## How is it used?

The idea is for information which usually sits in silos waiting for people to make connections to have an AI assistant find and suggest these.
It can be used across formal and informal information sources, with the creators consent.

Using textual analysis hot topics, problematic process and best practice can be highlighted.

All messaging types and data stores are potentially in scope.

## Challenges

Assumed versus presumed consent.  Access to some data sources likley to be restricted by comapny policy or technically more difficult to access because of security controls or encryption.  Language (human!) differences.

## What next?

Use across company and county boundaries should be encouraged.


## Acknowledgments

Some products such as messaging and marketing programs may have a similar function within the product.
